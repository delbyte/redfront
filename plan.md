nevermind that. actually, i need you to do all this-

first, all the emojis should be grayscale like they are now when the mouse isn't hovering over the panel, and become a redscale when we do hover, instead of the colors they have rn. 
then - 

1. make the network graph better (have connecting lines and whatnot, better size and capacity for links, scrollable draggable like a map in obsidian) and align with the other tools we have
2. move the intel reports section to the end, it should be the last panel
3. the check breaches button in the email panel doesn't do anything 
4. the phone number functionality is hardcoded, not acceptable, at least have real dicta with all the info that you can then cross ref or find a cdn
5. add more currencies that are popular in the crypto thing, and also integrate real wallet tracking if possible without too much hassle
6. real ip analysis, and also geolocation button doesn't do anything right now
